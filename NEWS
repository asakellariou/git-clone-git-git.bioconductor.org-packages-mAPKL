Change history of package mAPKL:
====================================

Version 1.1.1:
- A new function, the "probes2pathways" has been added.
- I have added to more network reconstruction approaches. The "aracne.a" and 
  the "aracne.m" as included in the "parmigene" r-package.
- I have replaced in the "preprocess" function the type of the produced image from 
  jpeg to tiff format, with resolution=300dpi.
